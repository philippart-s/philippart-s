Currently I work for Harmonie Mutuelle as software architect.

For several years, I have been involved in setting up development bases for project teams (java, angular, esb, etc.) and providing support to them to best support them in the adoption of these technologies.

This support is reflected, by the creation and the share of  *inner-source* Frameworks.

I maintain and upgrade the CI / CD chain based on Jenkins 2 (pipeline as code in Groovy).
In addition to these pipelines, I am participating in the deployment of OpenShift.
This allows me to facilitate my other role which is to facilitate the adoption of DevOps principles within my company.

I'm still a passionate developer for over 20 years, mainly in Java (JEE, Spring, ...) but also in other languages ​​such as Groovy, Typescript (Angular), ...


Sharing and transmission are for me two essential things in my approach to the developer profession, which is why I co-created the association [TADx] (https://www.tadx.fr) which has for objective of organizing a monthly session of presentations made by speakers around agility, DevOps but also all the human relations in the development jobs.

Always in the knowledge sharing, I realize as a speaker, internal conferences in my company but also some external conferences ([Touraine Tech] (https://touraine.tech/) and [codeurs en seine] (https://touraine.tech/)).
